## 📋 Project Overview

### 🎯 Goal

Build a production-grade distributed logging platform similar to **Datadog Logs** or **ELK Stack**, designed to handle enterprise-scale log processing with real-time analytics.

---

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🔒 **Secure Ingestion** | Collects structured logs from multiple apps via secure HTTP API |
| ⚡ **Scalable Processing** | Uses Kafka for scalable, durable log ingestion |
| 🔄 **Batch Processing** | Processes logs with consumer group workers for optimal performance |
| 💾 **High-Performance Storage** | Stores logs in analytical databases (TimescaleDB or ClickHouse) |
| 🔍 **Advanced Querying** | Offers filtering, querying, and optional analytics dashboard |
| 🛡️ **Fault Tolerance** | Supports backpressure, retries, and dead-letter queues |
| 🏗️ **Microservice Design** | Built with clean separation of concerns and scalability in mind |

## 🔐 Production Considerations

### Security
- **Authentication**: mTLS or API keys for secure log ingestion
- **Authorization**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for query operations
- **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest

### Observability
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for comprehensive system metrics
- **Alerting**: Real-time alerts for system health and performance
- **Logging**: Structured logging for troubleshooting and audit trails

### Fault Tolerance
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Isolation of problematic messages for analysis
- **Batching**: Efficient processing to handle high-volume scenarios

### Scalability
